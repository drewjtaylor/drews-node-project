# This is the node/express server created as a side project during my Nucamp class.

The main goal of this website is to track events and users in MongoDB and set up endpoints for users to perform basic CRUD operations on this information.

Whether a user is logged in or not, they are able to perform GET requests to retrieve event information.

Any user set up as an "admin" can add, edit, or delete events, in addition to being able to view users.

Any user NOT set up as an admin will be able to create events and edit their own events, but nothing else.

# Testing

In order to test endpoints, you will need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed globally, and you will need a program to directly test the endpoints such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). I used postman, so any screenshots or instructions here will assume you have the same, but Insomnia should work as long as you know how to perform the same steps.

Create a root folder named "data"

From the parent folder of "data", run the following:

<code>mongod --dbpath=data</code>

# Routes

![all events retrieved using postman](./demo-screens/all-events-postman.jpg)

If the body of the request has a start date, all events for that day are returned.

If the body of the request has a startDate and endDate, all events on or between those dates will be returned.

DELETE: Clear all events from database
Requires bearer token from an Admin to be present.

POST: Create a new event
Requires a bearer token from a valid user. Does not require that user to be an admin.

The body must contain a name, description, and eventDate in JSON format. The eventDate must be a string that can be fed into <code>new Date(eventdate)</code> to create a valid javascript Date object.

## /events/:eventId
